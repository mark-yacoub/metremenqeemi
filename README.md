## About the Curriculum
The Curriculum is roughly based on the Coptic curriculum of St. Athanasius Deacons School at St. Mary and St. Athanasius Church, Madinet Nasr, Cairo, Egypt. It's considered the best deacons school out there.

The Curriculum used on the app is a condensed version as it doesn't dwell on hymns analysis.

## About the Tree
As this is a Coptic learning app, some common terms have been changed to their Coptic meanings:

The **master** branch has been renamed to **neeb** (Ⲛⲏⲃ).

Git **origin** renamed to **moumi** (Ⲙⲟⲩⲙⲓ).

So, when you pull master it will be `git pull neeb`

and when you push to origin it will be `git push moumi`

## About the formatter & packages
We use `ESLint` and `Prettier`, download the extensions on your editor.

We use `yarn` rather than `npm install`
